# Face-Recognition-with-Siamese-Network

Overview:
This project implements a face recognition system using a Siamese neural network. The Siamese network is trained to determine whether two given images represent the same person. This approach is particularly useful for tasks like one-shot learning, where the model needs to recognize a face with only a few examples.

Features:

Image Preprocessing: Efficiently preprocesses images for training and evaluation.

Siamese Network Architecture: Utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract features from images and compare them using a distance metric.

Face Verification: Determines whether two face images belong to the same person.

Packages Required:
The following packages are required to run this project-

os

cv2 (OpenCV)

random

numpy

matplotlib.pyplot

tensorflow
